# Undo-Redo-System-using-Stacks-in-python
A simple Undo/Redo Text Editor implemented in Python. The project demonstrates how undo and redo functionality can be built using two stacks (one for undo history and one for redo history). Itâ€™s a great example for beginners learning about data structures, command history management, and basic text editing operations.
